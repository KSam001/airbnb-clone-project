# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb's booking platform. This project serves as a hands-on learning experience to master modern software development practices, including backend development, database design, API security, and CI/CD pipelines. By building a scalable and secure system, the project aims to provide practical skills for real-world software engineering.

## Project Goals
- Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub for version control and project management.
- Deepen understanding of backend architecture and relational database design with PostgreSQL.
- Implement secure APIs using GraphQL and industry-standard security practices.
- Gain proficiency in setting up and managing CI/CD pipelines with tools like GitHub Actions.
- Strengthen skills in documenting and planning complex software projects.
- Learn to integrate technologies such as Django, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, and Docker into a cohesive system.

## Technology Stack
- **Django**: A Python web framework used to build RESTful APIs and server-side logic for features like booking and user management.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database for storing and managing project data, such as user profiles and property listings.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for creating flexible and efficient APIs that enable the frontend to request specific data from the backend.
- **Docker**: A containerization tool that packages the application and its dependencies for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD tool for automating testing, building, and deployment of the application to ensure reliable code changes.

## Team Roles
- **Backend Developer**: Develops the server-side application using Django, implementing business logic for features like booking and user management.
- **Database Administrator**: Designs and manages the PostgreSQL database schema, ensuring data integrity and efficient query performance.
- **API Developer**: Builds secure GraphQL APIs to enable communication between the frontend and backend, focusing on authentication and data security.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Configures Docker for consistent development environments and sets up GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD pipelines.

## Database Design
The database is structured to support the core functionality of the Airbnb Clone Project using PostgreSQL. Below are the key entities, their important fields, and their relationships.

- **Users**:
  - Fields: `user_id` (unique identifier), `email`, `password` (hashed), `name`, `phone_number`.
  - Purpose: Stores user account information for authentication and profile management.
- **Properties**:
  - Fields: `property_id` (unique identifier), `host_id` (foreign key to Users), `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`.
  - Purpose: Represents rental properties listed on the platform.
- **Bookings**:
  - Fields: `booking_id` (unique identifier), `property_id` (foreign key to Properties), `user_id` (foreign key to Users), `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`.
  - Purpose: Tracks reservations made by users for properties.
- **Reviews**:
  - Fields: `review_id` (unique identifier), `property_id` (foreign key to Properties), `user_id` (foreign key to Users), `rating`, `comment`.
  - Purpose: Stores user feedback and ratings for properties.
- **Payments**:
  - Fields: `payment_id` (unique identifier), `booking_id` (foreign key to Bookings), `amount`, `payment_date`, `status`.
  - Purpose: Records financial transactions for bookings.

**Relationships**:
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties** (one-to-many: `host_id` links to `user_id`).
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings** and **Reviews** (one-to-many: `property_id` links to both).
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings** and submit multiple **Reviews** (one-to-many: `user_id` links to both).
- Each **Booking** is associated with one **Payment** (one-to-one: `booking_id` links to `payment_id`).

## Feature Breakdown
The Airbnb Clone Project includes the following core features, each contributing to a seamless user experience and robust functionality.

- **User Management**: Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles, ensuring secure access to the platform and personalized experiences.
- **Property Management**: Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings, providing a dynamic inventory of rentals for users to browse.
- **Booking System**: Facilitates users reserving properties for specific dates, streamlining the rental process and ensuring accurate availability tracking.
- **Review System**: Permits users to leave ratings and comments for properties, building trust and aiding decision-making for future guests.
- **Payment Processing**: Handles secure financial transactions for bookings, ensuring reliable and safe payment flows for users and hosts.

## API Security
API security is critical to protect the Airbnb Clone Projectâ€™s data and ensure user trust. The following measures will be implemented:

- **Authentication**: Uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to verify user identity, ensuring only authorized users access protected endpoints like booking or profile data.
- **Authorization**: Implements role-based access control to restrict actions (e.g., only hosts can edit their property listings), preventing unauthorized operations.
- **Rate Limiting**: Caps the number of API requests per user to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks, maintaining system performance.
- **Data Encryption**: Employs HTTPS and encrypts sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment details) to safeguard user information during transmission and storage.

**Why Security Matters**:
- **Protecting User Data**: Encryption and authentication prevent unauthorized access to personal details, fostering trust.
- **Securing Payments**: Robust security ensures safe transactions, critical for user confidence and legal compliance.
- **Preventing Abuse**: Rate limiting and authorization protect the system from malicious activity, ensuring availability and reliability.

## CI/CD Pipeline
A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes, improving development efficiency and reliability.

- **What is CI/CD?**: Continuous Integration (CI) involves automatically testing code changes to catch errors early, while Continuous Deployment (CD) automates deploying tested code to production, ensuring fast and reliable updates.
- **Importance for the Project**: CI/CD pipelines reduce manual errors, speed up feature delivery, and ensure the application remains stable as new code is added.
- **Tools Used**:
  - **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows for testing (e.g., running Django unit tests) and deploying the application to a server.
  - **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments by packaging the application and its dependencies, simplifying deployment across development and production.

By leveraging these tools, the project achieves a streamlined development process, enabling rapid iteration and high-quality code.
