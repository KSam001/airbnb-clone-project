# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb's booking platform. This project serves as a hands-on learning experience to master modern software development practices, including backend development, database design, API security, and CI/CD pipelines. By building a scalable and secure system, the project aims to provide practical skills for real-world software engineering.

## Project Goals
- Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub for version control and project management.
- Deepen understanding of backend architecture and relational database design with PostgreSQL.
- Implement secure APIs using GraphQL and industry-standard security practices.
- Gain proficiency in setting up and managing CI/CD pipelines with tools like GitHub Actions.
- Strengthen skills in documenting and planning complex software projects.
- Learn to integrate technologies such as Django, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, and Docker into a cohesive system.

## Technology Stack
- **Django**: A Python web framework used to build RESTful APIs and server-side logic for features like booking and user management.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database for storing and managing project data, such as user profiles and property listings.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for creating flexible and efficient APIs that enable the frontend to request specific data from the backend.
- **Docker**: A containerization tool that packages the application and its dependencies for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD tool for automating testing, building, and deployment of the application to ensure reliable code changes.

## Team Roles
- **Backend Developer**: Develops the server-side application using Django, implementing business logic for features like booking and user management.
- **Database Administrator**: Designs and manages the PostgreSQL database schema, ensuring data integrity and efficient query performance.
- **API Developer**: Builds secure GraphQL APIs to enable communication between the frontend and backend, focusing on authentication and data security.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Configures Docker for consistent development environments and sets up GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD pipelines.
