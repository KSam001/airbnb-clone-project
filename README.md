# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb's booking platform. This project serves as a hands-on learning experience to master modern software development practices, including backend development, database design, API security, and CI/CD pipelines. By building a scalable and secure system, the project aims to provide practical skills for real-world software engineering.

## Project Goals
- Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub for version control and project management.
- Deepen understanding of backend architecture and relational database design with MySQL.
- Implement secure APIs using GraphQL and industry-standard security practices.
- Gain proficiency in setting up and managing CI/CD pipelines with tools like GitHub Actions.
- Strengthen skills in documenting and planning complex software projects.
- Learn to integrate technologies such as Django, MySQL, GraphQL, and Docker into a cohesive system.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django (Python framework for building the server-side application)
- **Database**: MySQL (relational database for storing user and booking data)
- **API**: GraphQL (query language for efficient and flexible API development)
- **DevOps**: Docker (containerization for consistent development environments), GitHub Actions (automated CI/CD pipelines)
